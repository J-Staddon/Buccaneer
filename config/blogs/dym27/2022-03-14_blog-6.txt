Week 6: (14/03/2022)

Assigned actions
================

Action 1: Continue working on JavaFX UI

I worked on the UI "todo" list written by ses35.
I also spent time on re-writing the initialize method in the board controller so that the board maintains a constant aspect ratio.

Hours: 3

Other project work
==================

I had issues compiling the project and was not able to get a successful build which made debugging UI elements difficult and made
it hard to commit changes to the project. I instead researched JavaFX, and how I can properly incorporate css into it in a
maintainable way so that I can quickly and effectively catch up with the "todo" list once I can properly build the project.

Hours: 2

Total hours: 5
