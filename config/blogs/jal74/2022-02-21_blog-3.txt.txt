Assigned actions
===============
Action 1: Go Through the SE.QA.08 document and check that the main branch of the repository is as the document describes how it should be

There were some changes that needed doing like adding a config_refs file to the config file, adding files to the docs directory for the individual files to go in and create a dev file as we were missing it

Hours: 1

Action 2: Sort out the problem with having 2 versions of the week 2 minutes

I got rid of the second document while making sure the original document contained all the updates made to it

Hours: 0.5

Action 3: Watch videos / read guides on more advanced ways of using GitLab in order to be able to take advantage of all of GitLab's tools

I watched some videos showing different things that you can do using GitLab and i also read guides / articles in order to get a better undestanding of how GitLab works. I will continue to research this in order to be confident with using the system we have and to be able to make any necessary adjustments.
