Assigned actions
================

Action 1: Continuing Looking at Objects and their interactions in the program.

I took the advice that came out of the last tutorial to improve the treasure
and port objects. I removed the abstract class and definitions for it to be used
as more of a class than an object. I additionally changed the port class to island,
so it can incorporate the flat island data, with a boolean determining if it's a trading post.

Hours: 2

Implemented FR1 to FR10 via object loader class with all the hardcoded default values and calculations related to crew cards and treasure.
