Week 2: (12/02/2022)

Assigned actions
================

Action 1: Looking at Objects and their interactions in the program.

I went through the requirements specification in detail and produced a plan for linking the UI
to backend data objects involved in the game. This includes linking map squares to objects such as
ship and ports. Having ships and ports including data classes such as treasure and crew cards for trading.
I also had to decide which classes would be declared as abstract and used as a baseclass for instances with
different data. I then produced the chance card class with an interface so the base instance can be overridden
by super classes for unique interactions. The original map square class extends the UI stackpane allowing the UI
to access all of these backend data classes.

I additionally setup a diagram to present these interactions as it is important for these interactions to be
understood in detail by the group so the backend code can be implemented correctly.
