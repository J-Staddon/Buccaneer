Assigned Actions
=================
Action 1: Setting up the project arrangements

Read through the Project Requirements and Group Info documents and highlighted the lines I
saw as the key points/information. Also, created this first blog entry and pushed it to the 
correct folder in the Group repository.

Hours: 2

Action 2: Initial Task

Read SE.QA.04 and highlighted key information and made notes on things that I thought might
help with elements of the UI document and some questions I think we need to answer though 
the coming weeks. Then I created some sketches of possible layouts for the main game display
based on the information set out in SE.QA.04 and the buccaneer requirements document.

Hours: 2

Other project work
=====================
Some of the group met up to attempt to play the game and make sure we understood how it was
played and what we'd need on the screen during play. Discussed possible implementations of 
some of the more ambiguous chance cards and how the layout of the game for 4, instead of 6,
players would affect gameplay.

Hours: 2
